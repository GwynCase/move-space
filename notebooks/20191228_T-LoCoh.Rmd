Using KDEs and MCPs I tried to examine how much space a goshawks use, whether the amount of space used varies between individuals and by sex, or by breeding period (nestling, fledgling, etc.). Unfortunately, I don't really have enough data to look at anything other than the nestling period or for all periods, but I do have the groundwork for figuring it out later, once I get the rest of my data.

Those are very basic questions, and I do need to answer them. But the question I'm really more interested in is not how *much* space goshawks use, but *how* they use it, and whether they use different parts of it for different purposes. I think the T-LoCoh method will be very fun for this.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load some libraries.
library('tidyverse')
library('dplyr')
library('lubridate')
library('sf')
library('tlocoh') # Requires the FNN package also.
library('sp')
library('rgdal')

# Read in the data.
df <- read.csv('../data/processed/telem_all.csv',
               header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE) %>%
  drop_na('lat')

# Select just one site to work with.
ska <- df %>% filter(site == 'SKA')

# To make a lxy object, we need datetime and coordinates.

# Do the datetime thing.
datetime <- ymd_hms(ska$datetime, tz='America/Vancouver')

# Do the spatial thing. This is a bit different than usual.
ska.sf <- SpatialPoints(ska[ , c('lon', 'lat')],
  proj4string=CRS('+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs')) %>%
  spTransform(CRS('+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs'))

ska.coords <- coordinates(ska.sf)
colnames(ska.coords) <- c('x', 'y')

# Make a lxy object.
ska.lxy <- xyt.lxy(xy=ska.coords, dt=datetime, id='HAR05',
                   proj4string=CRS('+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs'))

# Look at some stuff.
summary(ska.lxy)
```
I can't show the `plot` output bc reasons, but it's really cool.
```{r echo=TRUE}
hist(ska.lxy)
```
The median time step of 16 minutes shows that generally, the tag isn't missing too many points, since it's supposd to take a point every 15 minutes. The step length and velocity also show that the bird mostly travels short distances at low speed. That may be biased downward because of roosting behavior.
