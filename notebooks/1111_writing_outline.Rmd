# Introduction

Forest type (& prey base) * forest character (& abundance) -> home range size.

Prey abundance * prey availability -> habitat selection
  Math differs based on available prey!

Therefore prey base & landscape combine to determine habitat selection and home range size.

How much & what kind of habitat to preserve for NOGO? Depends on what they're eating.
