title: "Roosting"

Realized I was going down a rabbit hole with the VRI and decided to focus on going down a different rabbit hole. Here's my plan of attack:

* Select points taken during the night. These are presumably points when the bird was roosing.
* Do some kind of cluster analysis to locate clusters of points. One cluster per night should indicate where the bird slept that night.
* Generate a centroid point for each cluster.
* (Maybe) do some recusion analysis to see if the bird often returns to the same place to roost or not.
* Prep data for RSF.
* Do the RSF thing to see what kind of forest NOGO like to roost in. Working from the assumption that NOGO only roost in forest, I can look at:
    * Forest age
    * Forest density
    * Dominant tree spp
    * Distance to edge - though this is challenging bc some cut blocks are misIDd
    
```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load up some libraries.
library('tidyverse')
library('sf')
library('ggplot2')

# Bring in some telemetry data.
tel.all <- read.csv('../data/processed/telem_all.csv', stringsAsFactors=F)

# Pull out a toy to work with.
ska <- tel.all %>%
  filter(site == 'SKA') %>%
  drop_na(lat)

ggplot(ska, aes(x=lon, y=lat)) +
  theme_void() +
  geom_density_2d()
```

As usual, I can't show the actual points, but this gives the idea. The next step is to separate out the nighttime points.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# More libraries.
library('lubridate')
library('suncalc')

# Do the datetime thing.
ska$date <- ymd(ska$date)
ska$datetime <- ymd_hms(ska$datetime, tz='America/Vancouver')

# Calculate sunrise and sunset times for each day.
ska <- getSunlightTimes(data=ska, keep=c('sunrise', 'sunset'), 
                        tz='America/Vancouver')

# Classify points as daytime or nighttime.
ska <- ska %>%
  mutate(dial=case_when(
    datetime < sunset & datetime > sunrise ~ 'day',
    TRUE ~ 'night'
  ))

# Pull out the nighttime points.
ska.night <- ska %>%
  filter(dial == 'night')

# Take a look.
ggplot(ska.night, aes(x=lon, y=lat)) +
  theme_void() +
  geom_density_2d()
```

Now that I have the nighttime points I need to group them into clusters and find their centroids.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Round each point to the nearest midnight.
ska.night <- ska.night %>%
  mutate(day=round_date(datetime, unit='day'))

# Average the locations.
centroids <- ska.night %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarize(m.lat=mean(lat), m.lon=mean(lon))

write.csv(centroids, '../data/interim/roost_centroids_ska.csv', row.names=FALSE)

# Take a look.
ggplot(centroids, aes(x=m.lon, y=m.lat)) +
  theme_void() +
  geom_density_2d()
```
